        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Cook egg noodles according to package directions. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water, drain and return to the pot. Stir in soup and up to 1/2 cup reserved cooking water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a small pan over medium heat. Add onion and celery. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add vegetables, cheese, tuna and peas to pot with noodles and stir to combine. Transfer to a 9-by-13-inch baking pan and topped with potato chips.</li>
            <li>Bake until top is browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
            <li>Clear a path to the bathroom.</li>
